# Affan's Portfolio (React + Vite)

Welcome to my personal portfolio, built using **React + Vite** — a fast, responsive, cinematic single-page site that showcases my dev skills, real-world projects, and creative journey.

This is more than just a résumé — it's a digital experience. Clean UI, smooth animations, dark mode, motion-reactive visuals, and SEO packed.
